- Add back cmd functionality with Cobra
- Filepicker input for local source (if it supports multi-selection)
- Progress bar during parsing? Would need to send back how many scripts it is once they've been fetched or counted?
- Basic translation table set up (at least for main story) with war IDs and their translated names, to ensure consistency between local and atlas usage (with a flag to ignore).
- Buttons on "parse" step to ignore ID input and parse predetermined collections (arcs, all main story, etc)
