## TODO

- Have a basic translation table set up for main quest war IDs and names, so the program always knows what to use (and can flag to use folder names if local)?
- Allow entering multiple IDs at once
- Verbose flag
- Have a list of pre-counted chapters (main story) and a flag to ignore it
- Ability to choose to count all of Part 1, EoR, Part 2, OC?
