### Possibly upcoming features

- Ability to sort results table in tui
- Add back cmd functionality with cobra (see Charm's Pop)
- Figure out how to get directories or multiple picks at once with filepicker
- Basic translation table set up (at least for main story) with war IDs and their translated names, to ensure consistency between local and atlas usage (with a flag to ignore).
  - For local files it probably needs to go by the script file numbers
- Shorthand flag for atlas to count all wars in a given arc
