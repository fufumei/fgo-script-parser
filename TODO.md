### Possibly upcoming features

- Clipboard functionality to copy row from results table
- Option to also include word count (characters / 2) in results
- Figure out how to get directories or multiple picks at once with filepicker
- Basic translation table set up (at least for main story) with war IDs and their translated names, to ensure consistency between local and atlas usage (with a flag to ignore).
  - For local files it probably needs to go by the script file numbers
- Shorthand flag for atlas to count all wars in a given arc
